# Interesting notes about when i was developing this app in VUE

### 1. This was the first "frontend" that is started developing in before react + angular

I had previous experience with vue with small example application. I did enjoy the starting development
of this application. I first developed everything in 1 big single page. I did enjoy haveing all my methods
in 1 class + same for css.

Doing the components and defining it was "easy" but it does take getting used to to include it correctly and display
any sub compontents.
```
 components: {
SearchView,
TaskView
},
```

Defining the lifecycle and "CODE" part in the components is a bit of a pain if it gets large so that 
was bit of negative, nice that everything is there but still.


#### Data binding
I did find the data binding bit getting used to but once i got it working it was nice
` v-model="" :class="" @click="">CHECK</button>`
